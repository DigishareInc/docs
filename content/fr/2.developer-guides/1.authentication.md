Secure access to the Digishare API is mandatory. We support two primary methods of authentication depending on your integration needs.

::note
All API requests must be made over **HTTPS**. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail.
::

## 1. Personal Access Token

The **Personal Access Token (Bearer Token)** is ideal for server-to-server integrations, scripts, or when you are building an integration for your own organization.

::steps

### Generate Token

Navigate to **Settings > Personal Access Tokens** in your Digishare dashboard and click **Generate New Token**.

### Copy Token

Copy the token immediately. For security reasons, it will **not** be shown again.

### Authenticate

Include the token in the `Authorization` header of your HTTP requests.
::

### Try It Out

::api-playground{method="GET" url="https://api.digishare.ma/v1/campaigns" description="List all your campaigns using Bearer Token authentication." :variables='{"token": "YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"}' :headers='{"Authorization": "Bearer {token}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}'}
::

## 2. OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials

Use the **Client Credentials Grant Flow** if you are building a third-party application or service that acts on its own behalf.

::steps

### Get Credentials

Obtain your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from the **Developer > Applications** page.

### Request Token

Exchange your credentials for an access token via the `/oauth/token` endpoint.

### Use Token

Use the returned `access_token` in the `Authorization` header for subsequent requests.
::

### Token Request

::api-playground{method="POST" url="https://api.digishare.ma/v1/oauth/token" description="Exchange client credentials for an access token." :headers='{"Content-Type": "application/json"}' :body='{"grant_type": "client_credentials", "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID", "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"}'}
::

### Token Response

```json
{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 31536000,
  "access_token": "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
}
```

::warning
**Security Best Practice:** Never expose your `Client Secret` or `Personal Access Token` in client-side code (browsers). These should only be used in secure server-side environments.
